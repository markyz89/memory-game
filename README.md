## Instructions


To begin the game, simply click on any card to begin. The timer will start running the moment you click on a card. After revealing your first card, choose a second card to compare it against. Each card has an icon. There are 16 cards in the deck, and 8 unique icons. The object of the game is to match the card to the only other card in the deck that has the same icon. 

If the icon on your second card matches the icon on your first card, the cards will turn green and remain displayed.

If the icons do not match, the cards will turn red, before hiding themselves again.

Once the cards have either matched or not matched, you will have the opportunity to pick two more cards. Try to remember where each card is after it has been hidden, as if you find the icon again, you will want to match it to the one you saw previously.

Once you have found all eight pairs of cards, the game is won.

Your rating depends on how many attempts to match cards you make.

If you can complete the game in less than 13 moves, you earn three stars.
Less than 19 moves earns two stars
Less than 26 moves earns one star.
Less than 28 earns earns half a star.
While completing the game in 28 or more moves earns ...
